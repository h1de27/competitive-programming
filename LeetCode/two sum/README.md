# Solution

## Approach 1: Brute Force 

The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element xx and find if there is another value that equals to target - xtargetâˆ’x.

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[j] == target - nums[i]) {
                return new int[] { i, j };
            }
        }
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
    
### Time complexity 

For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of array which takes *O(n)* time.
Therefore, the time complexity is *O(n^2)* .

### Space complexity

*0(1)*
